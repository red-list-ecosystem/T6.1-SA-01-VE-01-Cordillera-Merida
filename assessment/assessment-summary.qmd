# Assessment outcome

The Tropical glacier ecosystem of the Cordillera de MÃ©rida is **Critically Endangered** with strong evidence of being **Collapsed**: CR (CR-CO) based on most of the criteria assessed A1, A2b, A3, B1+2a(i)bc, C1, C2a, E.

All criteria with sufficient data indicate the highest level of threat from historical (A1, A3, C1), present (A2b, B1 and B2) and future (C2a, E) processes.

All evidence suggests that the small remaining patch of glacier ice in Humboldt peak is experimenting rapid decline and unlikely to recover mass before its disappearance.
