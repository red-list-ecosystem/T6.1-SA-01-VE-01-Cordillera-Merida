    "text": "Preface\nThis document uses the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems guidelines to diagnose the collapse of the Tropical glacier ecosystems of the Cordillera de Mérida in Venezuela.\nTropical glaciers are rapidly disappearing, particularly in isolated mountain peaks and lower elevations (below 5000m). These glaciers are fundamental substrates for unique cryogenic ecosystems in tropical environments where the ice, melting water and rocky substrate sustain microbiological communities and other meso- and macro-biota.\nThe IUCN Red List of Ecosystems assessment protocol provides a valuable framework for comparative analysis of threatened ecosystems. We undertook the assessment with existing data derived from field observations and samples, literature review, cartographic reconstruction, remote sensing products and climatic models, and complemented these with additional statistical analysis and modelling to calculate and predict rates of decline and relative severity of degradation.\nThe evidence suggests an extreme risk of collapse (Critically Endangered, CR) due to prolonged and acute declines in ice extent and changes in climatic conditions that are leading towards a complete loss of ice mass. The biotic compartments of the glacial ecosystem will consequently be lost, with ice loss also initiating a decades-long succession of forefield vegetation. Even the most optimistic climate change projections are unlikely to prevent imminent ecosystem collapse in this region.\nThis assessment is summarised in Ferrer-Paris et al. (2024).",

    "text": "1.2 Ecosystem description\nTropical glacier ecosystems are cryogenic ecosystems in tropical environments where the main substrate is formed by ice accumulated over several years and provides different habitats to microbiological communities and other meso- and macro-biota. Tropical glaciers share key features with other glaciers, such as the icy substrate; atmospheric deposition of nutrients; a biota dominated by micro-organisms with cold-adaptation traits that inhabits several habitat compartments on (supra-), in (endo-) or below (subglacial) the icy substrate; truncated trophic networks; and very low productivity and diversity (Anesio & Laybourn-Parry, 2012; Hotaling et al., 2017; Keith et al., 2020).\nTropical glacier ecosystems are originally formed by processes of snow and ice accumulation and ablation over geological time frames. However the characteristic microbiota can persist in the ice substrate even if processes of ice accumulation have ceased or the overall mass balance of ice is negative.\nThe Tropical glacier ecosystem of the Cordillera de Mérida is described here as a distinct ecosystem type that formerly occupied several peaks above 4600 m in the Sierra Nevada National Park in the state of Mérida, Venezuela. It is geographically isolated from the nearest occurrences of Tropical glacier ecosystems in Colombia and has distinct bioclimatic characteristics.",

Analysis is still underway (Huber et al. in prep.), with preliminary results indicating a large diversity, marked changes in microbiota composition and function, and a sizeable role of the microbiota on ecosystem processes in four sites deglaciated between 1910 and 2009.\n\n\nMacrobiota\nLlambí et al. (2021) studied the soil development and vegetation assembly in a chronosequence of four sites where the Humboldt glacier retreated between 1910 and 2009. Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are present near the borders of the receding glacier of peak Humboldt, but there was no significant interaction between time and BSC presence or between BSCs and soil properties. Soil organic matter and soil nitrogen increases progressively during the succession while some exchangeable bases (magnesium and calcium) decreased in sites older than 21 years.\nThe areas exposed in the last 10 years show a strong dominance of lichenized fungi (families Hymeneliaceae, Peltigeraceae, Stereocaulaceae, and Trapeliaceae) and bryophytes (Andreaeaceae, Bryaceaea, Cephaloziellaceae, Dicranaceae, Grimmiaceae, Polytrichaceae, Pottiaceae) with very few vascular plants.

    "text": "5.1 Processes and interactions\nTropical glacier ecosystem in the Cordillera de Mérida have a dynamic of ice accumulation and ablation influenced by precipitation (in the form of snow- or rainfall due to temperature fluctuations), temperature and solar radiation that can trigger annual and diurnal cycles of melting and freezing conditions, and the geomorphology that modulates the rate of basal melting and movement of the ice on top of the rocky substrate.\nMass balance of the icy substrate is likely dominated by interannual fluctuations (Andressen, 2007; Braun & Bezada, 2013), but no quantitative studies have been conducted. Substantial reductions in precipitation and higher exposure to solar radiation are expected with El Niño–Southern Oscillation years, while high precipitations and more cloud coverage are expected during La Niña years. However, these glaciers are believed to be out of balance (i.e. dominated by ablation that drives a continuing decline in ice mass and extent) due to their location near or even below theoretical equilibrium lines (Polissar et al., 2006; Braun & Bezada, 2013).\nReduction and fragmentation of the glacier ice extent makes them more vulnerable to scale and edge effects. When the glacier is below a critical size they are more exposed to the warm air produced by the incidence of solar radiation on the surrounding rocks, and this could explain accelerated shrinkage of the icy substrate (Ceballos et al., 2006). The Bolivar peak was fragmented and had higher perimeter to area ratio than the Humboldt peak in 1952 and 1998, and the Humboldt peak has experienced a dramatic increase in the perimeter to area ratio after 1998 (Ramírez et al., 2020).\nDeposition of light absorbing particles from the atmosphere on snow and ice can reduce glaciers surface albedo and enhance the melting process (Gilardoni et al., 2022). Concentration of black carbon in the high elevations of the Cordillera de Mérida have been linked to biomass burning in Venezuelan savannah, with higher fire activity and higher concentration following El Niño years (Hamburger et al., 2013).\nAtmospheric or aeolian deposition (windfall) provide key nutrients (e.g. Carbon, Nitrate and Ammonium) to the biota of the supraglacial zone (Edwards, 1987). Nutrients and meltwater can be transported through interglacial cracks and crevasses to reach the subglacial zone, where it combines with small particles produced by rock comminution (Hotaling et al., 2017). Englacial and subglacial biota of this ecosystem are still undescribed.\nThe role of the supra- and subglacial microbiota on the exposed glacier forefield is currently under study in the Cordillera de Mérida. The pioneer lichen and bryophyte species might have a facilitation effect on the long-term establishment of wind-dispersed and -pollinated vascular plants (Llambí et al., 2021).",

    "section": "5.2 Threats",
    "text": "5.2 Threats\nThe two main threats to the Tropical glacier ecosystem of the Cordillera de Mérida are climate changes and severe weather, and pollution by air borne pollutants (Table 5.1).\nReconstruction of glacier advances in the last 1500 years highlights their sensibility to natural changes in climate, and this has likely been magnified by the human influence on climate (Polissar et al., 2006). The effect of increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitations on the venezuelan glaciers over the last decades has been discussed by Braun & Bezada (2013). Evidence suggests that this is an ongoing threat affecting the whole distribution of the ecosystem and is likely to cause rapid declines.\nAlthough pollution by light absorbing particles could account for up to 22% of albedo reduction in parts of the tropical Andes (Gilardoni et al., 2022), the effect of such pollutants in the Cordillera de Mérida have not been measured (Hamburger et al., 2013). Thus the scope and severity of this threat are not known.\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Threats to the Tropical glacier ecosystem of the Cordillera de Mérida according to the IUCN Threat Classification and Threat Impact Scoring System\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThreat classification\nTiming\nScope\nSeverity\nScore\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Pollution\n\n9.5 Air-borne pollutants\n\n9.5.4 Type Unknown/Unrecorded\n\n\n\nOngoing\nUnknown\nUnknown\nUnknown\n\n\n\n11 Climate change & severe weather\n\n11.1 Habitat shifting & alteration\n11.5 Other impacts\n\n\nOngoing\nWhole (&gt;90%)\nRapid declines\nHigh Impact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndressen, R.

    "text": "According to Braun & Bezada (2013) and Ramírez et al. (2020) there is historical evidence of five or six glaciers or ice patches in the Cordillera de Mérida in the last 150 years, with earliest records dating back to 1864 (from paintings) and 1886 (from scientific literature). All but one have disappeared and can be considered collapsed due to the complete absence of permanent snow or ice:\n\nA small ice/firn field below Pico Mucuñuque (at 4609 m) at the Sierra de Santo Domingo existed at least until 1922.\nPerennial snow and ice cover on Pico El Toro (4728 m) existed around 1900 and a small glacier remained until about 1931.\nPico El Leon (4750 m) had perennial snow and ice cover around 1900 but was ice free in 1910.\nLa Concha was included in measurement of glacier extent in 1910 and 1952, but it disappeared before 1990.\nA glacier at Pico Espejo was located below Pico Bolivar and disappeared between 1936 and 1956.\nBolivar was included in measurement of glacier extent in 1910, 1952 and 1998, but was already fragmented (two patches) in 1998, it had a small remaining ice mass between 2011 and 2017 but was not longer considered a glacier (\\(&lt;0.01\\textrm{km}^2\\) in extent), a small remnant firn patch disappeared by 2020.\nHumboldt is the only remaining glaciated area.\n\nIn the cases of Pico Mucuñuque and Pico Bolívar, small remnants of ice were considered ‘static’ or extinct glaciers due to the absence of dynamic processes of ice accumulation. However, prospective microbiological studies in Pico Bolivar (Rondón et al., 2016, sampled ca. six years before its complete disappearance) and Pico Humboldt (Ball et al., 2014) suggest similar micro-biotas regardless of the size of the remaining ice substrate.\nThus we consider that the complete disappearance of permanent snow and ice is the best indicator of collapse.\nTropical glaciers are very sensitive to changes in climate, thus the evaluation of climate variables can help us infer the temporal changes in glacier conditions leading to their collapse. In the Cordillera de Mérida the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA; the elevation of the dividing line between the glacier accumulation and ablation areas) and the atmospheric freezing level height (FLH; the altitude of the 0°C isotherm) have been used as indicators of change in glacier extent (Polissar et al., 2006; Braun & Bezada, 2013). The increase in ELA or FLH reduces the available area for long-term glacier persistence, and a collapse threshold can be set according to peak height or the maximum elevation of the snow accumulation.\nWe also use an indirect approach to project the probability of persistence of Tropical glacier ecosystems into the future by means of correlative models of environmental suitability (Ferrer-Paris et al. in prep.). In this case the bioclimatic conditions of areas with and without glaciers are compared using a machine learning algorithm and a probability or suitability index is produced. This index can be calibrated with existing data to find optimal classification thresholds for discriminating presence and absence of the glacier under current conditions, and the model is then used to predict future suitability. In this case, the classification threshold is assumed to represent a collapse threshold.\n\n\n\n\nBall, M.M., Gómez, W., Magallanes, X., Rosales, R., Melfo, A. & Yarzábal, L.A.

Here we apply the formula: \\[\n\\mathrm{PRD} = 100 \\times (1-(\\frac{A_2}{A_1})^{\\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}})\n\\]. Where \\(A_1\\) is the extent in the start year \\(t_1\\), and \\(A_2\\) is the extent in the end year \\(t_2\\). We also calculate uncertainty using an error propagation formula based on the standard error of the measurements as reported by the original source.\nFor example, the proporional rates of decline based on the observed decline in the last 67 or 21 years are:\n\n\n\n\n\nstart date\nend date\ntime frame\nPRD\nS.E.\n\n\n\n\n1952\n2019\n67\n5.713\n0.130\n\n\n1998\n2019\n21\n10.220\n0.473\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can project the future extent (\\(\\hat{A_2}\\)) using a initial value (\\(A_1\\)) and assuming a constant PRD over \\(n\\) years:\n\\[\n\\hat{A_2} = A_1 \\times (1-(\\mathrm{PRD}/100))^n\n\\].\nFor example, using the two estimates of PRD calculated above using two different starting points:\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nExtent (km^2)\nS.E.

This allows to use all available measurements to estimate the value of PRD using maximum (quasi-)likelihood.\nWe fitted a generalised linear model with quasi-poisson distribution and logarithmic link function, and weighted observations by the inverse of the standard error of the measurements. We used the model to predict expected values of extent and standard errors for the time frame 1990 to 2040, and then derived the back-transformed best estimate and 90% confidence intervals considering over-dispersion and a normal approximation of the error distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: Extent of glacier ice measured between 1910 and 2019 and projected future extent using all seven observations with 90% prediction confidence interval (left panel), and using only the five most recent observations (blue line, right panel).\n\n\n\n\n\nA model fitted using all observations from 1910 onwards suggests a large proportional rate of decline ( Figure 7.1; left panel), but the most recent observation clearly deviate from the expected values (Figure 7.1; right panel, see Ramírez et al. (2020)). Another model fitted only to the most recent observations (1998 onwards), predicts a more pronounced decline, with narrower confidence intervals due to the small number of observations used .\nHere we transform the model parameter to the percentage scale of the PRD formula and calculate the magnitude of the decline for the period 1998 to 2048, we also include the lower and upper bounds of the 90% C.I.):\n\n\n\n\n\nPRD\nPRD lower\nPRD upper\ndecline\ndecline lower\ndecline upper\n\n\n\n\n3.576\n2.903\n4.298\n83.267\n76.996\n87.828\n\n\n9.497\n7.914\n11.063\n99.133\n99.116\n99.151\n\n\n\n\n\nThese values of PRD and the projected decline are lower than those obtained using the fixed PRD formula. This is because the linear model approach averages the rate of decline across all measurements, and probably underestimates or underplays the recent acceleration of the rate of decline (Ramírez et al., 2020). The model giving a value of \\(PRD &lt; 4.5%\\) is heavily influenced by the older observations and does not match the more recent measurements. We decided to discard it in favor of the alternative model and analytical estimates.\n\n\nAdditional considerations\nBoth projections based on analytical and linear regression estimates of the proportional rate of decline suggest declines above 80% in a 50 years time frame including past and future. Some estimates are close to 100%, indicating a likely collapse.\nGiven the very rapid decline of the glacier in the Bolívar Peak between 1998 and 2017, and the comparable size of the Humboldt glacier at the time of the last measurement (0.045 \\(km^2\\) by 2019) it is reasonable to expect that it would disappear completely within the next 20 years.\n\n\nAssigned category\nThe assessment unit is classified as Critically Endangered, with plausible bounds between Endangered and Collapsed: CR (CR-CO).\n\n\n\nSubriterion A3\nThe decline between the oldest and the most recent estimates of extent in Table 7.1 is estimated as:\n\n\n\n\n\nstart date\nend date\ntime frame\ndecline\nS.E.\n\n\n\n\n1910 [year]\n2019 [year]\n109 [year]\n99.10466 [%]\n0.08240714 [%]\n\n\n\n\n\nReconstruction of the historical evolution of glaciers in South America suggests that the maximum glacial extent in Venezuela occurred around the year 1730 and glaciers retreated continuously in the following centuries with only minor readvances around 1760, 1820 and 1880 (Polissar et al., 2006; Jomelli et al., 2009). Thus we can assume that the observed decline between 1910 and the present represents a lower bound of the total decline between 1750 and the present.\nFor subcriterion A3 we can assume that the historical decline in extent is &gt;99 %, thus the Tropical glacier ecosystems of the Cordillera de Merida are considered Critically Endangered with high risk of imminent Collapse: CR (CR-CO).",

We use this time series and fit a local polynomial regression (loess with gaussian distribution, span = 0.75 and degree = 2, equivalent number of parameters = 4.35) to smooth the temporal trend and compare these values with the altitudinal range of glaciers for each peak as reported by , Figure 7.2.\nIn the case of Pico La Concha the glacier ice had an estimated maximum elevation of 4840 m in the year 1952, and disappeared before 1998. The mean FLH was almost 10 meter below the maximum elevation in 1948 and rose to more than 83 meters above the maximum elevation in 2010. The smoothed FLH mean surpassed the 4840 m threshold between 1972 and 1981.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Time series of freeze level height (FLH in meters) in the Cordillera de Mérida for the period 1948 to 2011.

We used a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model to analyse the current climatic conditions in areas occupied by Tropical glacier ecosystems in all the tropics. Details of the model fitting and validation process are in preparation (Ferrer-Paris & Keith, 2024), brief summary follows.\nOccurrence records were selected using stratified random sampling from all the glacier outlines in tropical areas and 25 km distance buffers around glacier outlines. We applied a first partition of the data by withhold the occurrence records of the target assessment unit for final model evaluation of prediction performance of the model (target partition) and the rest of the occurrence records were used for model fitting (modeling partition). Random subsets of the modeling partition were divided in calibration (80%) and test partitions (20%) for tuning of model parameters (number of trees, interaction depth, shrinkage and minimum number of observations per node) using cross validation.\nWe used 19 bioclimatic variables from the CHELSA dataset representing climatological mean values for present conditions (1981-2010) as predictor variables (Karger et al., 2017). Variables were centered and scaled to zero mean and unit variance.\nWe fitted the GBM model for classification (two classes: glacier or not-glacier) using a bernoulli error distribution. The best performing model had following parameters:\n\n\n\n\n\nn.trees\ninteraction.depth\nshrinkage\nn.minobsinnode\n\n\n\n\n200\n5\n0.1\n12\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd predictive performance on the training dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\nROC\nSens\nSpec\nROCSD\nSensSD\nSpecSD\n\n\n\n\n0.9671479\n0.6214764\n0.9813436\n0.0084269\n0.0581879\n0.0047307\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also evaluated the predictive performance of the final model on the Cordillera de Merida:\n\n\n\n\n\nROC\nSens\nSpec\n\n\n\n\n0.990099\n0.6666667\n0.9960396\n\n\n\n\n\nWe used the final fitted model to predict the suitability in the present timeframe (1981-2010) and future timeframes (2011-2040 and 2041-2071). We considered uncertainty due to climate change projections (five general circulation models and three representative pathways), and due to the choice of optimal cut-off values of the confusion matrix of observed classes (glacier/non-glacier) vs. predicted suitability score. We selected thresholds of maximum accuracy (acc) and equal sensitivity and specificity (ess).\nWe summarised the outcomes for each combination of models, pathways and cut-off values and calculated relative severity for each of the three cells overlapping with current glacier outlines (Figure 7.3). Here we assume that the predicted suitability represent the initial and final value and the cut-off value represents the collapse threshold (transition from Glacier to Non-glacier class).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Outcome of model projections for two future timeframes considering five general circulation models, three representative pathways, and two collapse thresholds (acc: maximum accuracy; ess: equal sensitivity and specificity).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best estimate of mean relative severity across all predictions is 97.1 % with a 90% confidence interval of 63.2 to 100%.\nThe subcriterion C2a is assessed as Critically Endangered with a plausible bound of Endangered to Collapsed: CR (EN-CO)\n\n\nSubcriterion C3\nPolissar et al. (2006) used the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA; the elevation of the dividing line between the glacier accumulation and ablation areas) as a climatically sensitive measure of variations in glacier extent.\nThey first reconstructed the Mucubají valley paleoglacier topography from field data, aerial photographs, and topographic maps. They used this information to construct a normalized cumulative area vs. elevation profile and the ratio of accumulation area to total glacier area. This correspond to the period of maximum glacier extent between 1180 and 1820. Similarly, they calculated the cumulative elevation profiles of modern glaciers at the Pico Bolívar from existing maps of the year 1972. They compared the ratio of accumulation area to total glacier area to determine the respective ELA for both cases and provide estimates of their difference (\\(\\Delta\\) ELA).\nThe \\(\\Delta\\) ELA was calculated between -300m for the timeframe of the analysis (1820 to 1972) and -500 m considering the observed declines after 1972 and before 2006. This last value is considered to be near to the maximum possible value of \\(\\Delta\\) ELA.\nUsing three plausible values of \\(\\Delta\\) ELA (-300, -400 and -500 m) as the observed decline and a value of -550 m as the maximum decline we calculate that the relative severity is between 54 % and 90 %, with a middle value of 72.3%.\nSubcriterion C3 is assessed as Endangered with a plausible bound from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered: EN (VU-CR).",

    "text": "7.4 Criterion D\nThe biota of this assessment unit is poorly known, and there is no direct information on temporal changes in microbial communities in the different habitats after the loss of the ice substrate. Data collected at Humboldt peak in 2019 and 2021 may shed light on this issue. Analysis is still underway (Huber et al. in prep.).\nThe study of the glacier forefield at Humboldt peak provide a post-glacial chronosequence: vascular vegetation is already present after 10 years of the glacier retreat, and soil properties change significantly after 21 and 60 years (Llambí et al., 2021).\nCriterion D is evaluated as Data Deficient.",

    "text": "7.5 Criterion E\nWe use ice mass balance projections for the glacier of the Cordillera de Mérida based on a glacier evolution model (Rounce et al., 2023). This hybrid model combines a mass balance module and a glacier dynamics module to model glaciers independently from 2000-2100 for various ensembles of Global Circulation Models and scenarios.\nAccording to the published methods (Rounce et al., 2023):\n\nThe model computes the climatic mass balance (i.e., snow accumulation minus melt plus refreezing) for each surface elevation bin using a monthly time step. The model computes glacier melt using a degree-day model, accumulation using a temperature threshold, and refreezing based on the annual air temperature. Glacier geometry is updated annually using a flowline model based on the Shallow-Ice Approximation to explicitly account for glacier dynamics using a density of 900 kg m-3 for converting mass to volume.\n\nThis hybrid model is applied to all glaciers in the world independently, using globally available datasets of glacier outlines (Randolph Glacier Inventory Consortium, 2017), glacier-wide geodetic mass balance data and regional ice volume estimates for calibration (Farinotti et al., 2019; Hugonnet et al., 2021). In the case of small regions with no direct measurements (like the Cordillera de Mérida) the model uses initial estimates of ice volume based on digital elevation models and most likely overestimates initial mass, making the projections very conservative (Rounce et al., 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Estimated ice mass in Megatonnes for all glacier outlines of the Cordillera de Mérida for each shared socioeconomic pathways. Codes for Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP1-2.6 is a sustainable development scenario, SSP2-4.5 is intermediate, SSP3-7.0 prioritise national development and SSP5-8.5 is fossil-fueled development.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values used here are the output values (ice mass median absolute deviation) of the model for the four glacier outlines of the Randolph Glacier Inventory for the cordillera de Mérida downloaded from Rounce et al. (2022) and presented in Figure 7.4. These values clearly overestimate the existing ice mass but we focus the analysis on the point of collapse and not on the mass value per se.\nWe use these mass projections to estimate the year of collapse (first year when mass reaches zero) for each combination of models and scenarios. The empirical cumulative distribution function of the year of collapse (Figure 7.5) allow us to estimate the proportion of models indicating collapse for each year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: ECDF (empirical cumulative distribution function) plot of year of collapse for all models (black line) and for each shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP, labeled lines).\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the 50 year time frame between 2020 and 2070 we find that 79.2 % of the models end in collapse. Uncertainty in mass estimates (mean absolute deviation) do not have a major effect on the estimated year of collapse. Considering each scenarios separately, the proportion of models that predict collapse by 2070 is higher than 50% (threshold for CR) in all cases, except for scenario SSP1-2.6.\nCriterion E is evaluated as Critically Endangered.\n\n\n\n\nBraun, C. & Bezada, M.
