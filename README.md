# T6.1-SA-01-VE-01-Cordillera-Merida

This document uses the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems guidelines to diagnose the collapse of the **Tropical glacier ecosystems of the Cordillera de Mérida** in Venezuela.

The evidence suggests an extreme risk of collapse ([Critically Endangered](https://iucnrle.org/rle-categ-and-criteria),   <span style="padding: 2px; font-size:80%; border-radius: 22px; color: white; background-color: #ff0000; " id="text">CR</span>) due to prolonged and acute declines in ice extent and changes in climatic conditions that are leading towards a complete loss of ice mass. The biotic compartments of the glacial ecosystem will consequently be lost, with ice loss also initiating a decades-long succession of forefield vegetation. Even the most optimistic climate change projections are unlikely to prevent imminent ecosystem collapse in this region.
