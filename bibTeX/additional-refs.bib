	abstract = {Abstract. Although worldwide inventories of glacier area have been coordinated internationally for several decades, a similar effort for glacier ice thicknesses was only initiated in 2013. Here, we present the third version of the Glacier Thickness Database (GlaThiDa v3), which includes 3 854 279 thickness measurements distributed over more than 3000 glaciers worldwide. Overall, 14 \% of global glacier area is now within 1 km of a thickness measurement – a significant improvement over GlaThiDa v2, which covered only 6 \% of global glacier area, and only 1100 glaciers. In this paper, we summarize the sources and compilation of glacier thickness data and the spatial and temporal coverage of the resulting database. In addition, we detail our use of open-source metadata formats and software tools to describe the data, validate the data against this description, and track changes to the data following modern data management best-practices. Archived versions GlaThiDa are available from the World Glacier Monitoring Service (https://doi.org/10.5904/wgms-glathida-2019-03; GlaThiDa Consortium (2019)) and the development version (v3.1.0-rc1, from which this manuscript draft is generated) is available on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/wgms/glathida/-/tree/v3.1.0-rc1).},

              Topographic variation underpins a myriad of patterns and processes in hydrology, climatology, geography and ecology and is key to understanding the variation of life on the planet. A fully standardized and global multivariate product of different terrain features has the potential to support many large-scale research applications, however to date, such datasets are unavailable. Here we used the digital elevation model products of global 250 m GMTED2010 and near-global 90 m SRTM4.1dev to derive a suite of topographic variables: elevation, slope, aspect, eastness, northness, roughness, terrain roughness index, topographic position index, vector ruggedness measure, profile/tangential curvature, first/second order partial derivative, and 10 geomorphological landform classes. We aggregated each variable to 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 km spatial grains using several aggregation approaches. While a cross-correlation underlines the high similarity of many variables, a more detailed view in four mountain regions reveals local differences, as well as scale variations in the aggregated variables at different spatial grains.
