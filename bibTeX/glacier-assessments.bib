  abstract = {The height of the freezing level in the tropical atmosphere (the free air 0°C isotherm) has increased across most of the region, particularly in the outer Tropics. In the tropical Andes, south of the Equator, high elevation surface temperatures and upper air data show a similar trend in temperature, of ∼0.1°C/decade over the last 50 years. Meteorological observations at 5680 m on the summit of the Quelccaya Ice Cap, the largest ice mass in the Tropics, indicate that daily maximum temperatures often exceed 0°C from October–May, and rise well above freezing for much of the year around the ice cap margin at 5200 m. This is consistent with observations of a rise in the percolation facies (an indicator of surface melting) in recent decades, and other observations of marginal recession, showing that the ice cap is rapidly losing mass. Similar conditions are likely to be affecting other high elevation ice caps and glaciers in Ecuador, Perú and Bolivia, with important implications for water supplies in the region. Over the Tropics as a whole, freezing level height (FLH) is closely related to mean SSTs, with inter-annual variations in FLH controlled by the phase of ENSO variability. More extensive monitoring of climatic conditions at high elevations in the mountains of the Tropics is urgently needed.},

 abstract = {The disappearance of glaciers is Venezuela is chronicled through an extensive compilation and discussion of the scientific literature, maps, and historical photographs. Climate data analysis and GPS mapping in 2009 and 2011 provide the modern context. 20th-century glacier recession in Venezuela is similar to elsewhere in South America and consistent with the expected impacts of regional climate change. In 2011, one glacier with an area of about 0.1 km2 remained in Venezuela and it will likely disappear within this decade. However, the lack of local glacier and climate data limits our ability to appreciate the history of glaciers in Venezuela and a comprehensive monitoring program is urgently needed before Venezuela becomes an ice-free country.

La recesión glacial venezolana durante el siglo veinte es similar a otras partes de América del Sur y en consonancia con los efectos previstos del cambio climático regional. Hoy en día, solo un glaciar con una superficie de aproximadamente 0.1 km2 queda en los Andes venezolanos cerca la ciudad de Mérida, este probablemente desaparecerá en la presente década.

  abstract={Glacial-ice microorganisms are intensively studied world-wide for a number of reasons, including their psychrophilic lifestyle, their usefulness in biotechnology procedures and their relationship with the search of life outside our planet. However, because of the difficulties for accessing and working at altitudes of >5.000 m above sea level, tropical glaciers have received much less attention than their arctic and antarctic counterparts. In the present work we isolated and characterized a total of forty-five pure isolates originating from direct plating of melted ice collected at the base of a rapidly-retreating, small glacier located at around 4.900 m.a.s.l. in Mount Humboldt (Sierra Nevada National Park, Mérida State, Venezuela). Initial examination of melted ice showed the presence of abundant- (>106 cells ml−1), morphologically diverse- and active bacterial cells, many of which were very small (“dwarf cells”). The majority of the isolates were psychrophilic or psychrotolerant and many produced and excreted cold-active extracellular enzymes (proteases and amylases). The antibiotic tests showed an elevated percentage of isolates resistant to high doses (100 μg/ml) of different antibiotics including ampicillin, penicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and tetracycline. Multiresistance was also observed, with 22.22 % of the strains simultaneously resistant up to five of the antibiotics tested. Metal resistance against Ni++, Zn++ and Cu++ was also detected. In accordance with these results, plasmids of low and high molecular weight were detected in 47 % of the isolates. Twenty-two partial 16S rDNA sequences analyzed allowed grouping the isolates within five different phyla/classes: Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Flavobacteria. This is the first report concerning South American Andean glacial ice microorganisms.}

 abstract = {A population of 172 moss balls of Grimmia longirostris Hook. was studied in the Páramo de Piedras Blancas (Venezuelan Andes) at 4380 m. Moss ball transport in the paramo is caused primarily by needle-ice activity, with wind being a secondary agent. Moss ball size and shape varied widely, but were closely correlated. Larger globoids were significantly less spheroidal than smaller ones. This occurs because heavier moss balls rest for increasingly long periods of time on one side, thus becoming flattened. Several moss forms are described, including a type (pedestal mosses) attached to pebbles. Globular mosses lacked pebbles at their core, which was formed by silty soil and organic matter. Moss balls had a high content of organic matter (19%) and fine mineral grains (69.3%); the last is nearly four times higher than in site soils. This concentration of silt and clay results from moss balls trapping fine eolian dust and soil material as globoids roll over the ground. Due to their composition, globular mosses have a superior ability to store water compared to paramo soils. Larger moss balls had a greater water-holding capacity than smaller ones; they also lost water at considerably slower rates. This may be ecologically significant for moss ball growth and survival during dry periods.},

Although documentation of glacier retreat in Venezuela commenced over a century ago, an updated reconstruction at sufficient spatial resolution is warranted. Our objectives were to (a) produce detailed multitemporal maps of glacier cover in the SNM since 1952 and revise historical estimates for 1910 and (b) document changes in cover and rates of glacier retreat of the last Venezuelan glacier at Humboldt Peak. We integrated multiple information sources, including topographic/geomorphic evidence, high-resolution aerial photographs, satellite images, historical maps, panoramic photos, and field observations. We present 1:5,000 maps of glacier cover between 1952 and 2019 and revise the maps of 1910. In Venezuela, glacial area has decreased 98 percent between 1952 and 2019 (from 2.317 km2 to 0.046 km2). Glacier retreat rates increased after 1998, with a maximum of −16.9 percent year−1 between 2016 and 2019. These new maps should provide an essential tool for biophysical, ecological, and historical studies and a key reference for promoting awareness on climate change in the tropical Andes, where glaciers are intimately linked with cultural identity. }

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to document the evolution of glaciers in the tropical Andes (between 10°N and 16°S) for the last millennium, based on moraines dated by lichenometry and radiocarbon, lake sediment records and historical documents. Viewed collectively, several glacial advances occurred synchronously. The first advance is dated around AD 1200–1350. The maximum glacial extent (MGE), defined as the furthest down-valley extent recorded synchronously by the majority of glaciers, occurred around 1630–1680 in Bolivia and Peru (the outer tropics) and around AD 1730 in Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela (the inner tropics). Subsequently, during the 18th and 19th centuries, glaciers retreated continuously with only minor synchronous readvances. In the outer tropics, minor glacial advances occurred around 1730, 1760, 1800, 1850, and 1870. In the inner tropics, synchronous minor advances occurred around 1760, 1820 and 1880. Between the MGE and the early 20th century, glaciers lost about 30% of their total length. The retreat was slow between the 17th and 18th centuries but then became more marked. Use of the accumulation area ratio (AAR) method or historical observations in the different cordilleras revealed an increase in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of about 300 m from the MGE onward. Palaeoclimatic hypotheses, based on glaciological models run in different countries, suggest a cool and humid period in the 16–18th centuries followed by a colder and drier period in the 19th century. The reduction of glaciers observed from the middle of the 19th century is due to increasingly warmer conditions than before. Here, quantitative estimates are proposed to explain the evolution of the glaciers. In Venezuela, results indicate for the period 1250–1820 that mean air temperatures were 3.2±1.4 °C cooler and precipitation was about 22% higher than at present. In Ecuador, temperatures of between 0.8° and 1.1 °C lower than today, and between 25% and 35% higher accumulation than today, appear to have occurred in the 18th century, followed by a short drier but colder period at the beginning of the 19th century. In Bolivia, the MGE could be a consequence of a decrease in temperature of 1.1 to 1.2 °C, and a 20 to 30% increase in accumulation or an increase in cloudiness of about 1–2/10. We discuss not only external climatic forcing but also the coincidence between glacier expansion and a decrease in solar irradiance. Dating uncertainties, however, have made the role of volcanism in glacier fluctuations impossible to determine. Finally, we discuss the relationships between ENSO and glacier fluctuations in recent centuries, which do not match directly with current knowledge of modern teleconnections between tropical Pacific SSTs and variations in glacier mass balance.}

      abstract = { Examination of the dynamism of snowlines and treelines could provide insights into environmental change processes affecting land cover in the tropical Andes Mountains. Further, land cover at these ecotones represents a powerful lens through which to monitor and understand ecological processes across biophysical gradients while acknowledging their socioenvironmental dimensions. To illustrate this approach, we draw on recent research from two sites in the high tropical Andes where, at the regional scale, land cover assessments document retreating glaciers and changing amounts of forest cover, even though steep topographic gradients impose spatial shifts at much finer scales. Our results show that heterogeneous patterns of glacier recession open up new ecological spaces for plant colonization, potentially forming new grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands. In addition, treeline shifts are tied to changes in woody plant dominance, which can vary in rate and pattern as a result of aspect, past land use, and current livelihoods. We suggest that the telecoupling of regional and global biophysical and socioeconomic drivers of land use and land cover change to specific landscape combinations of elevation, aspect, and slope position might explain much of the spatial heterogeneity that characterizes landscape stasis and flux in mountains. }

  abstract = {Recent glacial and climate models suggest that glaciers located in contrasting climates could respond with different magnitudes to identical climatic perturbations. This implies that to understand the response of glaciers to a particular climate perturbation or to compare glacial fluctuations between different regions, climate conditions that permit glaciers to exist must be taken into account. In this study we systematize, classify, and identify the spatial distribution of the climates that permit the occurrence of present-day glaciers in the climatically diverse Andes. A first approximation suggests that a sample of 234 Andean glaciers exist under three distinctive combinations of temperature and precipitation conditions: i) cold and dry, ii) intermediate, and iii) warm and wet conditions. Cluster analysis (CA) and Principal Component analysis (PCA) of temperature, precipitation, and humidity reveal seven climatic configurations that support present-day Andean glaciers and suggest that these configurations have a distinctive geographical distribution. The groups are: 1) inner tropics and Tierra del Fuego, 2) wetter outer tropics, 3) drier outer tropics, 4) subtropics, 5) central Chile-Argentina (semi-arid), 6) northern and central Patagonia, and 7) southern Patagonia. This classification provides a basis to examine the spatial variability of glacier sensitivity to climate change, to unravel the causes of past glacial fluctuations, to understand the climatic signals driving present-day glacier fluctuations, and perhaps to predict the response of glaciers to future climate changes.}

However, studies from the 1930s used terrestrial imaging, and aerial photographs are available from the 1950s on. In this article, we review the literature on remote sensing of the glaciers in the tropical Andes, divided into the four climatic sub-regions: inner tropics, dry outer tropics, northern wet outer tropics, and southern wet outer tropics. The majority of studies used optical remote sensing, particularly Landsat and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery, although shadows produced by steep terrain and often dense cloud cover – within the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) of the inner tropics – are challenges to data analyses. Microwave and lidar remote sensing have been successfully employed in some studies. The vast majority of glacier monitoring studies documented glacier recessions throughout the tropical Andes since the 1950s; most results are available for the Peruvian Andes, particularly the Cordillera Balance. Recent field tests explored the use of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and lidar in glacier research; preliminary results are promising and have the potential to lead into new research directions. }

  abstract = {Abstract Along with air temperatures, the freezing level height (FLH) has risen over the last decades. The mass balance of tropical glaciers in Peru is highly sensitive to a rise in the FLH, mainly due to a decrease in accumulation and increase of energy for ablation caused by reduced albedo. Knowledge of future changes in the FLH is thus crucial to estimating changes in glacier extents. Since in situ data are scarce at altitudes where glaciers exist (above ~4800 m above sea level (asl)), reliable FLH estimates must be derived from multiple data types. Here we assessed the FLHs and their spatiotemporal variability, as well as the related snow/rain transition in the two largest glacier-covered regions in Peru by combining data from two climate reanalysis products, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar Bright Band data, Micro Rain Radar data, and meteorological ground station measurements. The mean annual FLH lies at 4900 and 5010 m asl, for the Cordillera Blanca and Vilcanota, respectively. During the wet season, the FLH in the Cordillera Vilcanota lies ~150 m higher compared to the Cordillera Blanca, which is in line with the higher glacier terminus elevations. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5) climate model projections reveal that by the end of the 21st century, the FLH will rise by 230 m (±190 m) for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 850 m (±390 m) for RCP8.5. Even under the most optimistic scenario, glaciers may continue shrinking considerably, assuming a close relation between FLH and glacier extents. Under the most pessimistic scenario, glaciers may only remain at the highest summits above approximately 5800 m asl.},

In this paper we report on the biodiversity of the culturable fraction of bacteria colonizing Pico Bolívar’s glacier ice and subglacial meltwaters, at ∼4950 m in the Venezuelan Andean Mountains. Microbial cells of diverse morphologies and exhibiting uncompromised membranes were present at densities ranging from 1.5 × 104 to 4.7 × 104 cells/mL in glacier ice and from 4.1 × 105 to 9.6 × 105 cells/mL in subglacial meltwater. Of 89 pure isolates recovered from the samples, the majority were eurypsychrophilic or stenopsychrophilic, according to their temperature range of growth. Following analysis of their 16S rDNA nucleotidic sequence, 54 pure isolates were assigned to 23 phylotypes distributed within 4 different phyla or classes: Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Actinobacteria dominated the culturable fraction of glacier ice samples, whereas Proteobacteria were dominant in subglacial meltwater samples. Chloramphenicol and ampicillin resistance was exhibited by 73.07\% and 65.38\%, respectively, of the subglacial isolates, and nearly 35\% of them were multiresistant. Considering the fast rate at which tropical glaciers are melting, this study confirms the urgent need to study the microbial communities immured in such environments. }

Among these, we hypothesized the presence of bacteria able to exhibit well-known plant growth promoting traits (PGP). These kinds of bacteria have been employed for the development of commercial biofertilizers; unfortunately, these biotechnological products have proven ineffective in colder climates, like the ones prevailing in mountainous ecosystems. In the present work, we prospected glacial ice collected from two small tropical glaciers, located above 4.900m in the Venezuelan Andes, for cold-active PGP bacteria. The initial screening strategy allowed us to detect the best inorganic-P solubilizers at low temperatures, from a sub-sample of 50 bacterial isolates. Solubilization of tricalcium phosphate, aluminum- and iron-phosphate, occurred in liquid cultures at low temperatures and was dependent on medium acidification by gluconic acid production, when bacteria were supplied with an appropriate source of carbon. Besides, the isolates were psychrophilic and in some cases exhibited a broad range of growth-temperatures, from 4°C to 30°C. Additional PGP abilities, including phytohormone- and HCN production, siderophore excretion and inhibition of phytopathogens, were confirmed in vitro. Nucleotidic sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes allowed us to place the isolates within the Pseudomonas genus. Our results support the possible use of these strains to develop cold-active biofertilizers to be used in mountainous agriculture.}

  abstract = { ABSTRACTBackground: The páramo provides key ecosystem services, including regulation and provision of water. To understand the underlying functions, an ecosystem approach is necessary.Aims: We quantified the combined effect of vegetation and soils (integrated topographic and vegetation units – TVU) on the hydrological balance of a Venezuelan páramo micro-watershed and analyse its hydrological response to intra- and interannual rainfall variability.Methods: Data (2008–2016) from meteorological stations of TVUs and of a streamflow station was used to calculate watershed level hydrologic balances. We quantified the impact of the TVUs outputs by calculating evapotranspiration under non-standard conditions (ETc adj).Result: Evapotranspiration of wetlands and tarns was high, exceeding annual precipitation. Shrubland had low evapotranspiration. Recharge of páramo reservoirs (soils, wetlands, tarns) occurred when monthly rainfall exceeded 90 mm. In dry years there were lower water yields with less effective hydrological regulation. In average years the differences between input and output in watershed balances were very small.Conclusions: The high and constant evapotranspiration of the wetlands and tarns (due to permanent water availability) suggests they could maintain streamflow during dry periods. Their high evapotranspiration rates are compensated by low rates in shrublands units, reducing the mean total evapotranspiration of the watershed. The watershed balances suggest a limited regulatory capacity in these relatively dry páramos with no volcanic soils. }

We propose a Global Deal for Nature—a companion to the Paris Climate Deal—to promote increased habitat protection and restoration, national- and ecoregion-scale conservation strategies, and the empowerment of indigenous peoples to protect their sovereign lands. The goal of such an accord would be to protect half the terrestrial realm by 2050 to halt the extinction crisis while sustaining human livelihoods.}",

@article{Stansell_2014_ProglacialLakes_Merida,
	abstract = {Lake sediment records from the Cordillera de M{\'e}rida in the northern Venezuelan Andes document the history of local glacial variability and climate changes during the Holocene (∼12 ka to the present). The valleys that contain these lakes have similar bedrock compositions and hypsometries, but have different headwall elevations and aspects, which makes them useful for investigating the magnitude of past glaciations. There was widespread glacial retreat in the Venezuelan Andes during the early Holocene, after which most watersheds remained ice free, and thus far only valleys with headwalls higher than ∼4400 m asl contain evidence of glaciation during the last ∼10 ka. There was a pronounced shift in sediment composition for the Montos (headwall: ∼4750 m asl) and Los Anteojos (headwall: ∼4400 m asl) records during the middle Holocene from ∼8.0 to 7.7 ka when conditions appear to have become ice free and drier. There is tentative evidence that the glacier in the Mucubaj{\'\i} valley (headwall: ∼4609 m asl) advanced from ∼8.1 to 6.6 ka and then retreated during the latter stages of the middle Holocene. Clastic sediment accumulation in other nearby lake basins was either low or decreased throughout most of the middle Holocene as watersheds stabilized under warmer and/or drier conditions. In the Montos record, there was another major shift in sediment composition that occurred from ∼6.5 to 5.7 ka, similar to other regional records that suggest conditions were drier during this period. Overall, the late Holocene was a period of warmer and wetter conditions with ice extent at a minimum in the northern tropical Andes. There were also punctuated decadal to multi-centennial periods of higher clastic sediment accumulation during the last ∼4 ka, likely in response to periods of cooling and/or local precipitation changes. In watersheds with headwalls above 4600 m asl, there is evidence of glacial advances during the Little Ice Age (∼0.6--0.1 ka). The pattern of glacial variability is generally similar in both the northern and southern tropics during the Little Ice Age, suggesting that ice margins in both regions were responding to colder and wetter conditions during the latest Holocene. The observed pattern of Holocene climate variability in the Venezuelan Andes cannot be explained by insolation forcing alone, and tropical ocean influences were likely associated with the observed glacial and lake level changes.},

abstract = {Glacier mass loss affects sea level rise, water resources, and natural hazards. We present global glacier projections, excluding the ice sheets, for shared socioeconomic pathways calibrated with data for each glacier. Glaciers are projected to lose 26 ± 6\% (+1.5°C) to 41 ± 11\% (+4°C) of their mass by 2100, relative to 2015, for global temperature change scenarios. This corresponds to 90 ± 26 to 154 ± 44 millimeters sea level equivalent and will cause 49 ± 9 to 83 ± 7\% of glaciers to disappear. Mass loss is linearly related to temperature increase and thus reductions in temperature increase reduce mass loss. Based on climate pledges from the Conference of the Parties (COP26), global mean temperature is projected to increase by +2.7°C, which would lead to a sea level contribution of 115 ± 40 millimeters and cause widespread deglaciation in most mid-latitude regions by 2100. Mountain glaciers, perennial ice masses excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, are a critical water resource for nearly two billion people and are threatened by global warming. Rounce et al. projected how those glaciers will be affected under global temperature increases of 1.5° to 4°C, finding losses of one quarter to nearly one half of their mass by 2100 (see the Perspective by Aðalgeirsdóttir and James). Their calculations suggest that glaciers will lose substantially more mass and contribute more to sea level rise than current estimates indicate. —HJS Glaciers are melting more rapidly than expected due to global warming.}}
