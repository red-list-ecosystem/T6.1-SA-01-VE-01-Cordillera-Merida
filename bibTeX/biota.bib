abstract = {Abstract The worldwide distribution of microinvertebrates on glaciers, the coldest biome, is poorly known. Owing to their tolerance to hostile conditions, small size and dispersal abilities, nematodes, tardigrades and rotifers are considered cosmopolitan and together inhabit various ecosystems. In this study, we investigated their global distribution in cryoconite holes – a type of freshwater reservoir forming directly in the glacial ice that creates biodiversity hotspots on glaciers. We analysed cryoconite samples (using classical microscopic observations and environmental DNA metabarcoding) from 42 glaciers located around the world (the Arctic, Subarctic, Scandinavia, the Alps, the Caucasus, Siberia, Central Asia, Africa, South America and Antarctica), as well as using literature data. Samples from Antarctic, Karakoram and the Alps were analysed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and classical observations under microscopes, while all other samples were analysed by microscope alone. Three general outcomes were found: (1) tardigrades and rotifers represented the most common invertebrates in cryoconite holes; (2) tardigrades and rotifers often coexisted together, with one or the other dominating, but the dominant taxon varied by region or by glacier; (3) nematodes – the most abundant, hyperdiverse and widespread metazoans on Earth, including in environments surrounding and seeding glacial surfaces – were consistently absent from cryoconite holes. Despite the general similarity of environmental conditions in cryoconite holes, the distribution of tardigrades and rotifers differed among glaciers, but not in any predictable way, suggesting that their distribution mostly depended on the random dispersal, extreme changes of supraglacial zone or competition. Although nematodes have been found in supraglacial habitats, cryoconite hole environments seem not to provide the necessary conditions for their growth and reproduction. Lack of physiological adaptations to permanently low temperatures (~0°C) and competition for different food resources in the cryoconite hole environment may explain the absence of nematodes in cryoconite holes.},

abstract = {Abstract High-alpine life forms and ecosystems exist at the limits of habitable environments, and thus, are especially sensitive to environmental change. Here we report a recent increase in the elevational limit of anurans following glacial retreat in the tropical Peruvian Andes. Three species have colonized ponds in recently deglaciated terrain at new record elevations for amphibians worldwide (5244–5400 m). Two of these species were also found to be infected with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), an emerging fungal pathogen causally associated with global amphibian declines, including the disappearance of several Latin American species. The presence of this pathogen was associated with elevated mortality rates of at least one species. These results represent the first evidence of upward expansion of anurans to newly available habitat brought about by recent deglaciation. Furthermore, the large increase in the upper limit of known Bd infections, previously reported as 4112 m in Ecuador, to 5348 m in this study, also expands the spatial domain of potential Bd pathogenicity to encompass virtually all high elevation anuran habitats in the tropical Andes.},

abstract = {Summary As glacier shrinkage is accelerating due to climate change, it is important to understand the effect of changes in glacier runoff on downstream aquatic communities. The overall goal of this study was to test the relevance of recently developed wavelet-based metrics of flow variations caused by glacial melting cycles to deepen our knowledge about the relationship between glacial influence and aquatic biodiversity. In an equatorial glacierised catchment, we selected 15 stream sites covering a gradient of direct contribution from glacial runoff. At each site, we recorded water level time series for 10 months and sampled benthic macroinvertebrates. Wavelet analyses on the water level time series were used to calculate three indices: glacial flood intensity, frequency and temporal clustering. We then examined how these three indices were related to macroinvertebrate community composition using generalised additive models. While macroinvertebrate density decreased significantly with glacial flood intensity, we found a significant hump-shaped relationship between local taxon richness and glacial flood intensity, a pattern that was not produced simply by overlapping broad taxon distributions from either end of the environmental gradient. These results suggest that glacial meltwater contribution creates local peaks in macroinvertebrate richness and enhances regional diversity in the catchment. The significant relationships between faunal metrics and the new glacial influence indices suggest the latter are valuable for assessing the effects of altered meltwater contributions on aquatic communities of glacier-fed rivers. Relationships differed depending on the feature of the glacial disturbance considered (glacial flood intensity, frequency, temporal clustering). We anticipate that these distinctions may help disentangle the mechanisms driving aquatic biodiversity in glacierised catchments, especially in terms of identifying resistance and/or resilience as key processes in glacial macroinvertebrate communities.},

abstract = {Summary 1. During the past two decades, understanding of the structure and function of glacier-fed stream ecosystems at temperate latitudes has increased substantially. In contrast, information on their tropical counterparts is very limited. We studied three neighbouring glacier-fed streams in the tropical Andes of Ecuador. Our main goals were (i) to determine overall longitudinal patterns in density, taxon richness and the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages and driving factors in equatorial glacial streams and (ii) to examine variability among replicate streams in faunal metrics and assemblages, and stream-specific effects of supposed environmental key factors. 2. We measured four geographical and 17 environmental factors and collected five Surber samples (500 cm2) of macroinvertebrates at each of nine sites, three sites along three streams. The streams were located 1–5 km apart. In each stream, the three sites were placed at comparable distances from the glacier and were grouped as ‘upper’ (50–200 m), ‘middle’ (1.5 km) and ‘lower’ sites (3.5–5.6 km). 3. In total, 2200 individuals (64\% chironomids) were collected and 47 taxa (30 dipterans, 18 of these Chironomidae) identified. Density ranged from 176 to 372 ind. m−2, and the number of taxa ranged from 2 to 6 at the upper sites and 868–3044 ind. m−2 and 21–27 taxa at the lower sites. Density, number of taxa, rarefied richness and axis-1 coordinates from a MDS ordination increased logarithmically with distance from the glacier. These faunal metrics were equally related to altitude and glacier per cent of catchment and correlated with maximum conductivity, mean temperature, mean daily maximum temperature and a channel stability index. As expected, the mean difference in distance decay in similarity was higher at the upper (47\% km−1) than at the lower reaches (20\% km−1) of the streams. 4. The number of taxa varied among sites within the upper and middle groups, but not among the lower sites. In contrast, but in accordance with our expectation, assemblage composition did not differ among upper sites but did so at middle and lower sites, following a supposed decrease in environmental harshness along the streams. Relationships between faunal metrics and the four environmental variables mean temperature, the stability index, chlorophyll a and coarse particulate organic matter also varied among the three streams. Generalised linear model analyses revealed that temperature interacted with stream on macroinvertebrate density, while chlorophyll a had a significant effect on the number of taxa in interaction with stream and stability. 5. The basic predictions of the Milner et al. (2001a), model regarding longitudinal faunal patterns and temperature and stability as main driving factors were met by our three replicate equatorial glacial streams. Qualitative departures from the model were mainly because of zoogeographical differences. We demonstrated that variability in assemblages between comparable sites in closely situated streams was considerable, and the effect of key environmental factors varied among streams and interacted with other factors. Quantifying spatial variation in benthic assemblages may help us foresee possible consequences for biodiversity as a result of glacial retreat.},

abstract = {Glacial retreat areas offer an excellent opportunity for microbial ecologists to study ecological theories. The place of this study was the glacier retreat area of Iztaccíhuatl volcano in México (19.02°N, 98.62°W). Sampling took place at eleven different sites along the retreat area in 2008 and 2009. Soil samples (200g each) were frozen, and air-shipped to the laboratory and analysed for organic C and N, ammonia, nitrate and DNA content as a proxy for microbial biomass. The composition of the soil microbial community was analysed by ester-linked phospholipid fatty acid analysis and by PCR-DGGE. From the youngest sites to the oldest ones the pH increased from 2.5 to 5.1, electrical conductivity decreased. We found an increase of C and N along the chronosequence, and also an increase in microbial biomass. The C-to-N-ratio increased from around 4 at 5000ma.s.l. to 14 at 3800ma.s.l., indicating soil development. According to PLFA analysis the microbial community showed a clear shift from bacteria to fungi during the initial phase, while in the later phase the trend was reverse. From PCR-DGGE profiles it may be inferred that the diversity of the microbial community increased with time. Results confirm earlier studies on microbial succession in the Alps, North American Rocky Mountains and the Andes. The initial increase of fungi, and their subsequent decrease might be explained by the resource heterogeneity hypothesis. The results also indicate that in the future much larger sample sets should be used to make best use of the retreat continuum at this type of subtropical glaciers, and to perform a metagenomic analysis to deepen the understanding of microbial succcession at a genus or species level.}

The first colonist species over the new till, Senecio keniophytum, advanced at a rate similar to the retreat of the glacier. The species growing near the ice-front of Tyndall Glacier colonize in tandem with retreat of the glacier. Till age and stability of land surface are important environmental factors controlling the vegetation pattern around Tyndall Glacier. Till age is affected by the glacial fluctuation. The stability of the land surface is governed by the particle-size of the surface material which is controlled by landform, geology, and past climatic conditions. The pioneer species make humus which results in improved soil condition.

abstract = {Abstract Questions How has the Mt. Kenya plant community responded to recent glacial retreat? Has the recent glacial retreat been affected by increases in temperature? How have number of plant clumps and proportion of vegetation cover changed with distance from the glacier edge (i.e. till age)? Location From Tyndall Tarn to the foot of Tyndall Glacier of Mt. Kenya (0°6′ S, 37°18′ E), Kenya. Methods The topography, soils, vegetation and glacial distribution around the Tyndall Glacier of Mt. Kenya were investigated from 1992 to 2011. The effect of glacial retreat on the rate of movement of leading edge (upper distribution limit) of plant species was examined. The distribution of vegetation was examined in a permanent plot that was surveyed in 1996 and 2011. The effects of temperature variation on glacial retreat were assessed with a least squares regression model. Results Tyndall Glacier retreated at a rate of ~3 m·yr−1 from 1958 to 1997, which increased to 7–15 m·yr−1 between 1997 and 2011. The leading edge of Senecio keniophytum, the first pioneer species to establish after glacial retreat, advanced with glacial recession. It was sparse in 1996; by 2011, the number of clumps and proportion of cover had increased. Clump size was affected by distance from the glacier edge (i.e. till age) in areas of recent deglaciation but not in deglaciated areas >15 yr old. Monthly mean minimum temperature at Mt. Kenya increased by >2 °C from 1963 to 2011, and glacial retreat was related to increase in monthly mean minimum temperature. Conclusion The glaciers on Mt. Kenya have diminished rapidly in recent years, and pioneer plant species have advanced in response. The movements of some species do not appear to be directly spatially related to glacial retreat but may be related to increases in air temperature, soil development, seed dispersal limitation and interval of masting. Recent unusually high temperatures and precipitation also likely caused the blooming of some species during atypical seasons.},

We tested this hypothesis in tropical alpine environments above 4700 m a.s.l. (Central Andes) and we explored the underlying mechanisms at work by using four sites gradually deglaciated since the acceleration of warming in the late 1970’s. These post-glacial chronosequences, made available by a multidisciplinary approach combining glaciology and ecology, are extremely rare and provide a pertinent space-for-time substitution for the study of climate change effects. We found consistent patterns in plant succession (abundance, species richness and functional strategies) along the four chronosequences. Dispersal limitation was a prominent constraint for succession, even at the end of the chronosequences, leading to an overrepresentation of anemochorous species in comparison with adjacent ecosystems. Nurse plants were infrequent and their low maturity seemed to make them poorly efficient as facilitators, contrarily to the expectations made by the stress-gradient hypothesis in alpine regions. This suggests that, despite the accelerating rate of warming, the dynamics of primary succession remains slow, generating a climatic debt and hampering the adaptation to climate change in alpine plant communities.}
